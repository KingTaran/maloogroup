        <h1>Background Matters!</h1>

        <p>
            Maloo Organisation’s presence in central India can be traced back to over five decades
            when in the year 1969 it took shape in the form of a Pharmacy by the name of “M/s.
            Jain Medical Store” / “M/s. Maloo Medical Store” at Mahasamund in the erstwhile state of
            Madhya Pradesh.
        <br>
        <br>
            With the dint of sheer hard work, vision and self-belief Mr. Ashok Maloo laid the
            foundations of the Maloo Group of Organisations as we see them today. Hard work never
            goes waste and so it was in his case too; his hard work paid abundant returns and rich
            dividends and he subsequently moved the business to Raipur and started M/s. Maloo
            Pharmaceuticals, a business model based on distribution and wholesale of pharmaceutical
            products. He focused on the finer aspects of distribution like market coverage and
            serviced with great fervour the interiors and micro interiors of Chhattisgarh.
        <br>    
        
        <br>    
            Chhattisgarh is truly a land of opportunities. It is one of the richest States in mineral
            resources, culminating into Steel, Aluminum and Cement industries and abundant Power
            Production. And Raipur as the capital of Chhattisgarh, has witnessed and is still
            witnessing major growth in many sectors such as the real estate, manufacturing, trading
            and education to name just a few. Under the circumstances, with an ever burgeoning
            population, it is but natural that the medical sector wouldn’t be far behind.
        <br>
        <br>    
            The Organisation is now in the able hands of the leading next generation entrepreneur Mr.
            Amit Maloo who has imbibed the core business values from his father and brought in his
            own skills and personal capabilities to good effect thus leading a team that works.
            MGO believes in training, delegating and coordinating; its personal management style has
            been to invest in human assets and empower the employees with all the necessary tools,
            training and development that are perennially essential to help them perform and
            achieve companywide objectives along with synchronous personal and individual
            objectives of the people themselves.

     <h1>Founder's Message</h1>
     <p>I started this business from a small medical shop in a “C" class town in the erstwhile state of Madhya Pradesh. Today 
      we are the channel partners to several top national and MultiNational companies. We distribute ethically promoted 
      products and medical equipment as well as surgical products etc. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This journey has not only been fulfilling and fruitful, but it 
      has also helped us learn the true meaning and effect of 
      values that are so dear to us. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I would like to highlight some of the core values that are 
      deeply ingrained within us. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>“It’s not important of where you reach … it’s more important of how you reached there!”</b>

    <h1>Co-Founder's Message</h1>
    <b>“A name is never enough … it’s what you do that matters most!”</b>

    <p>Working with different Channel Partners necessitates either having or acquiring the ability to be able 
to mould oneself in to another’s cast; only then would we be able to work in synchronous unison. 
 
     <br>
     <br>
     The distribution network of companies extends from the supplier's loading dock to the customer's front 
door that is far beyond the walls of each company's warehouse. .
     <br>
     <br>
     “Mission - 3X” is our latest initiative that is totally driven by automated systems and processes. Though 
we are happy with our current offerings, “Mission - 3X” is going to take us to a whole new level. I am 
certain that it will further make us the undisputed preferred channel partner in Chhattisgarh as we 
energise channel efficiencies. I welcome you to join us for a life time of symbiosis.
